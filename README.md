ABSTRACT 
An *IoT-based Wet and Dry Waste Segregation Device* is an intelligent system designed to automate the classification of waste into wet 
(organic) and dry (inorganic) categories using advanced sensor technology and machine learning. 
The device employs moisture sensors, infrared sensors, gas sensors, and image recognition to accurately 
identify waste types and direct them into the appropriate bins using motorized flaps. 
Integrated with microcontrollers such as Arduino, the system processes real-time data and transmits waste analytics to a cloud-based platform
for monitoring and optimization. 
Wireless connectivity via Wi-Fi allows remote tracking of waste levels and timely collection alerts through a mobile or web-based interface.
By enhancing waste segregation efficiency, reducing human effort, and promoting recycling.
This IoT solution contributes to sustainable waste management in smart cities, households, industries, and public spaces.
