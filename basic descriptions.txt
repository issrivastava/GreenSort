1. Components Required
Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno/Nano/ESP8266/ESP32)
WiFi Module (ESP8266 if using Uno/Nano; ESP32 has built-in WiFi)
Moisture Sensor (for detecting wet waste)
IR Sensor or Ultrasonic Sensor (for detecting objects)
Servo Motor (for opening different bins)
Buzzer & LEDs (for alerts and indicators)
OLED/ LCD Display (for real-time status updates)
Power Supply (5V/12V battery or adapter)
IoT Platform (Blynk, Firebase, ThingSpeak, or MQTT)


2. Working Principle
Detection:

Waste is placed on a detection area.
An IR sensor detects the presence of waste.
A moisture sensor determines if the waste is wet or dry.
Segregation:

If moisture is detected, it is categorized as wet waste.
If no moisture is detected, it is categorized as dry waste.
A servo motor moves the waste to the correct bin.
WiFi Connectivity & Monitoring:

The system sends real-time data to a cloud platform via WiFi.
The user can monitor waste levels remotely on a mobile app or web dashboard.
